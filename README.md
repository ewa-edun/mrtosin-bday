# Happy Birthday Mom!
So my mom is turning 1 year older and I want to make her a website to show her how much I love herðŸ’–.

## Project Structure:
1. Landing Page: It will have nice animated background and a button right in the middle of the screen that will lead to the main page. this button should be animated as well. on top of the button, a text should be displayed that says "Click me".

2. Main Page: It will have another animated background. It starts with a centered header text that says "Happy Birthday Mom!" and underneath it, a screen that looks like a letter. This letter will have a heartfelt message written in it (you can put placeholder text right now) after this letter screen, a button will be below the letter screen that will lead to the gallery page. let the animations be smooth and the transitions be seamless.

3. Gallery Page: It will have another animated background and a screen with images that i can scroll through. each image will have a little description written below them. let the animations be smooth and the transitions be seamless.
